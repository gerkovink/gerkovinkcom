I advice, manage and supervise governments, companies and researchers on inference and causal estimation problems with incomplete data. I am always available for consultation: [drop me a line](mailto:g.vink@uu.nl) and we'll take it from there.

I have a broad experience as a consultant and have advised and trained government bodies, for-profit companies and institutions, NGOs, hospitals, universities and fellow researchers across the globe.
