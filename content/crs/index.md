I teach courses about multiple imputation and statistical programming in R to students, companies, statistical professionals and applied researchers. Most of these courses can be considered professional continuing education at a post-graduate level. If you would like to hire me for a private course, contact me for a quote.

*I can highly recommend the courses I teach on [`R`](https://www.utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/social-sciences/data-science-statistical-programming-with-r) and [`Imputation`](https://www.utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/social-sciences/data-science-multiple-imputation-in-practice) in the [Utrecht University Summerschool](https://www.utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/ "Come to Utrecht in the summer"); you'll get a comprehensive overview of the state of the art while keeping the course fees very affordable.*
