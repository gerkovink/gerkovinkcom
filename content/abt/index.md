I am a statistical scientist with a passion for educating people. I aim to be at the cutting edge of both teaching and research and have an interest in new developments concerning the presentation of data, results and knowledge. I have a specific interest for incomplete data problems, optimisation and programming. I am based in the Netherlands and work as an assistant professor at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) (Utrecht, Netherlands).

I live my life with a wife and two kids (5yo and 3yo), a bike, a home and with a huge lack of sleep.
